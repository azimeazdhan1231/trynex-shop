# TryneX Lifestyle E-commerce Platform

## Overview

TryneX Lifestyle is a complete static e-commerce platform specializing in custom gifts and lifestyle products. The platform features a customer-facing website with shopping cart functionality, order tracking, and a fully functional admin panel for managing products, orders, and site settings. The system integrates with WhatsApp for order processing and uses Supabase for data persistence.

## Current Status

The project has been cleaned up and optimized to include only the essential files for the working website. All unnecessary framework files have been removed, leaving a pure static website that can be deployed directly to Netlify or any static hosting service.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static Website**: Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript-based frontend with no build process required
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **External Dependencies**: Font Awesome icons, Google Fonts (Poppins), Supabase client library
- **Component Structure**: Separate JavaScript files for different functionalities (main.js, admin.js, products.js, track.js)

### Backend Architecture
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities
- **API Structure**: Direct Supabase client integration for CRUD operations
- **File Storage**: External image hosting via Unsplash URLs for product images
- **Fallback System**: localStorage backup for offline functionality

### Authentication System
- **Admin Access**: Hidden trigger mechanism (clicking gear icon 3 times) with password authentication
- **Password**: Static password (`Amits@12345`) for admin panel access
- **Session Management**: Local storage for maintaining admin authentication state
- **Security**: Client-side authentication with robust error handling

## Key Components

### Customer Interface
- **Product Catalog**: Dynamic display of custom mugs, t-shirts, keychains, and frames with category filtering

### Order Management System

- **WhatsApp Integration**: Automatic forwarding to business numbers (+880 1747 292277, +880 1940 689487)
